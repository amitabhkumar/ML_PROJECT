Compnents are all the Modules that we're probably going to create to use in the Project.

a. Initially, we create a Process called as "Data Ingestion". => We'll be reading a dataset from a Database or different kinds of Databases, or any other file Location.
   Data Ingestion is a part ofa Module, when we're robably develoing the entire ML Project.
   This will have all the CODE, that is related to READING the data.
   We'll also try to split the data into "TRAIN" & "TEST".

b. Then, we may do "Data Transformation".

c. Then, we may do "Data Validation".

d. Then, we'll train the Model.
   This will contain all the Code, related to Training a Model, the number of Trainig Models we want to use.
   Confusion Matrix for Classification Problem. R-square or adjusted R-square value for Regression Problem.

e. Then we may create "Model Pusher".
   This will be a "PICKLE" file which we can push into the Cloud.
